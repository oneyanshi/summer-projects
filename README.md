# :sunny: summer-projects :sunny: 
A repository for projects created in the summer of 2017. 

There might not be much, there might be a ton, who knows! Other repositories located here will also have their own README, so be sure to check that out. I'll be updating as I'm working on things, simple or nah, exercises, etc. 

- [ ] Twitterbot Transcend.exe revamp ; actually hook it up maybe? 
- [ ] A fun, simple video game that utilizes simple graphics(?)
- [ ] Python/Java/Other exercises
